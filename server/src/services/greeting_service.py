    Generate a personalized greeting for a customer based on their profile and pets.
    
    Instructions based on prompt:
    - Write a short, warm greeting (max 2 short sentences).
    - Mention pets by name, optionally including breed or life stage if relevant.
    - If a pet's birthday is near (Â±7 days), give a gentle heads-up like "getting ready to celebrate?"
    - If this is their first time logging in after a new pet was added, mention that
    - If they have multiple pets, you can say "shopping for [pet1 or pet2] today?"
